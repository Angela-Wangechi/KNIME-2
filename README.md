# KNIME-2
This is a KNIME Workflow based on the CRISP-DM Framework of a classification Model
# Purpose

The main phases of this framework is;
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modeling

# Models trained
- Logistic regression Model
- Decision Tree Model
# Additional Information
The workflow has been organized by grouping related nodes into metanodes.
The metanodes capture the different phases of the CRISP-DM framework as well as the various models that have been trained.
Different annotations have been used to provide brief descritions the metanodes.
